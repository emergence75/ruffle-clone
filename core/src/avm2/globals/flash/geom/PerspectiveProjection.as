	/**
	 * The `PerspectiveProjection` class provides an easy way to assign or modify the perspective
	 * transformations of a display object and all of its children. For more complex or custom
	 * perspective transformations, use the `Matrix3D` class. While the `PerspectiveProjection` class
	 * provides basic three-dimensional presentation properties, the `Matrix3D` class provides more
	 * detailed control over the three-dimensional presentation of display objects.
	 *
	 * Projection is a way of representing a three-dimensional object in a two-dimensional space,
	 * like a cube projected onto a computer screen. Perspective projection uses a viewing frustum
	 * (a rectangular pyramid) to model and project a three-dimensional world and its objects on the screen.
	 * The viewing frustum becomes increasingly wider as it moves further from the origin of the viewpoint.
	 * The origin of the viewpoint could be a camera or the eyes of an observer facing the screen.
	 * The projected perspective produces the illusion of three dimensions with depth and distance,
	 * where the objects closer to the screen appear larger than the objects farther from the screen.
	 *
	 * ![Frustum viewing area](/images/frustum.jpg)
	 *
	 * A default `PerspectiveProjection` object is a framework defined for perspective transformation of
	 * the root object, based on the field of view and aspect ratio (dimensions) of the stage.
	 * The projection center, the vanishing point, is set to the center of the stage, which means the
	 * three-dimensional display objects disappear toward the center of the stage as they move
	 * back in the z axis. The default viewpoint is at point (0,0) looking down the positive z axis.
	 * The y-axis points down toward the bottom of the screen. You can gain access to the root display
	 * object's perspective projection settings and change the field of view and projection center
	 * properties of the perspectiveProjection property through the root object's `DisplayObject.transform`
	 * property.
	 *
	 * You can also set a different perspective projection setting for a display object through the parent's
	 * perspective projection. First, create a `PerspectiveProjection` object and set its `fieldOfView` and
	 * projectionCenter properties. Next, assign the `PerspectiveProjection` object to the parent display
	 * object using the `DisplayObject.transform` property. The specified projection matrix and transformation
	 * will then apply to all the display object's three-dimensional children.
	 * 
	 * tbd: not tested, just playing arround...
